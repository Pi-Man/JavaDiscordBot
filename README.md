# JavaDiscordBot

umm, bot to play music in discord, has an interactable play bar with skip, fast forward, back, previous song, shuffle on/off, repeat on/off, seeking.

Uses LavaPlayer to play songs from YouTube Bandcamp and some other sites (only searches on YouTube though).

Can also save and load playlists (though loading long playlists can take a while)

configurable prefix and configurable text channel to listen to and configurable text channel to post the playbar in.
